# CPNT 262 Achievement 8 Async Fetch: Stephan Taylor

## Thoughts on this Achievement

- This assignment was very fun to do. It was a very satisfying feeling to fetch the api from storblok and have it work like the video described

- I would like to know I did this assignment before you changed the rubric of it. I hope this wont effect my mark as I don't think it's a public api

## Plan for March 27th

1. To download nuxt3
2. install npm
3. configure the `nuxt.config`
4. Add tailwind package
5. Add storyblok package
6. And attempt to figure out async on my own based on the prep videos provided

- I also setup my storyblok by following the guide from this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQB8FDYLSg&list=PLpiZ2xo9RFsbXq-HUn9AtKUoVB874oKf9) tutorial. This guide really made the setup easy. However, I did not get the image to load, but I will solve that problem tomorrow (March, 28th) during lab
  - I fixed this issue I was having with the image. Turns out, I didn't save the image into image saved into the assets folder of my project. Once I did that, the image appeared on storyblok.
